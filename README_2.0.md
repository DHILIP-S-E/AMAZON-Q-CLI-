# No need to edit configuration files
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Deep Dive

### 🧠 Game Discovery System
The auto-discovery system analyzes Python files to extract:
- **Game Title**: From comments, docstrings, or variables
- **Description**: From module docstrings or comments
- **Category**: Based on keyword analysis (jump→platformer, shoot→shooter)
- **Requirements**: From import statements
- **Multiplayer Support**: Detects network/multiplayer keywords
- **Tags**: Generated from code analysis

### 📈 Profile Management
```python
# Example: Recording a game session
profile_manager.record_game_session(
    game_id="super_pixel_runner",
    duration_seconds=300,  # 5 minutes
    score=1500
)

# Get recommendations
recommended = profile_manager.get_recommended_games(all_games, limit=3)
```

### 🎨 UI Management
```python
# Example: Theme switching
ui_manager.set_theme("neon")
color = ui_manager.get_color("primary")  # Returns (0, 255, 255)

# Layout switching  
ui_manager.set_layout("list")
config = ui_manager.get_layout_config()  # Returns layout settings
```

## 🔧 Customization Guide

}
```

### 🏆 Adding Custom Achievements
